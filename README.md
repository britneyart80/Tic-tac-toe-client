## Introduction

A Tic-tac-toe web application using front-end and backend technologies. Uses curl script, jQuery.ajax and HTTP requests to API servers to create token authentication functionality (sign up, sign in, change password and sign out), allowing the user to have their own personal account. Javascript and jQuery are used for game logic and game functionality. HTML, CSS and SCSS are used for front end user experience and design.


## Development Process

To develop this web application, I first sketched out wireframes of how I wanted my UI to look and respond to the user. I also wrote out a few user stories to map out what I want my web app to be able to do. Using these wireframes as reference, I built the front end design of my web application while working on the back-end, making small changes to both as I developed the app so that I always keep the UI looking good while adding functionality. I found this process to be very good as, when I finished the back-end functionality, the layout of the page was already set up so that I did not have things all over the screen needing to be styled. Furthermore, this way when I finished one section, I knew I could put the whole thing away and focus on the next, not having to go back and style it or add UX effects, as going back and forth makes it more difficult to keep track of what you've done.

## Problem Solving Strategy

Before I write out any function, I plan out in my head how I want to logic to run and list out the steps the function should take. This makes it easier to write the function because I have a clearer image of what should be happening in each step. When I came across bugs, I often used console logs to make sure the code was actually executing where I wanted it to and to make sure feedback I was getting from the server was as expected. Through this process, it became pretty easy to locate where the bug was coming from and I was able to solve any issues I came across.

## Additions

If I were to further this project, I would love to make the game multiplayer through different accounts, as right now, it can be multiplayer but the other player would be a guest and their data not saved. Furthermore, it would be a fun addition to change the icons depending on what theme you have chosen, or to allow the user to pick what their icons are.

## Wireframes and User Stories

As a player, I can sign in to my existing account or create a new one.
As a player logged in, I can change my password.
As a player logged in, I can open instructions to understand how the game is played
As a player logged in, I can play the tic tac toe game.
As a game player, I can start a new game whenever I feel like it.
As a game player, I can see how many games I have won on this account.
As a game player, I can see who's turn it is and which player I am.
